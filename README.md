#  bleEnvironmentScanner

A simple BLE scanner for macOS using SwiftUI.  Much of this is my experiment in learning
SwiftUI.

To Do: most of the content previews are disabled as they require static information.  I will look
to cache this information so that the previews can be easily fed.

Refactored, the specifics of each service are moved into the view level now.  At this point more simplification is required
as well as the refresh for the various characteristics need to be implemented.
